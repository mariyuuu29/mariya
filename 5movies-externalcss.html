<h1>My Favorite Movies</h1>
<p id="intro">I love watching horror movies especially the Final Destination series. Here are My top 5 Favorite Movies:</p>
<p class="movies"><b>Final Destination 1</b> starts with a teenager who has a vision of a plane crash and saves his friends. But soon after, one by one, each friend meets a terrifying death. The suspense keeps building throughout the film and makes it very intense.</p>
<p class="movies"><b>Final Destination 2</b> begins with a deadly highway accident. The survivors again try to escape death, but destiny catches them in horrifying ways. The creative death scenes and storyline make it one of the best sequels in the series.</p>
<p class="movies"><b>Final Destination 3</b> focuses on a group of friends who survive a roller coaster accident. The photos taken during the ride show clues about how they might die. This part adds more psychological fear along with the usual horror elements.</p>
<p class="movies"><b>Final Destination 4</b> also known as The Final Destination, involves a race track accident. The survivors think they are safe but unexpected and gruesome accidents keep happening. The 3D effects made this part even scarier.</p>
<p class="movies"><b>Final Destination 5</b> connects back to the first movie in a shocking twist. The deaths are more creative and the ending reveals a big surprise. This final chapter wrapped up the entire series in a mind-blowing way.</p>
