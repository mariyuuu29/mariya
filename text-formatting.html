	<p><b>Time is one of the most <em>valuable</em> things in our lives.</b> It never <small>stops or waits</small> for anyone. Once a <ins>moment is gone,</ins> we cannot get it back. That is why it is important to <i>use time wisely.</i> <strong>People who manage their time well are often more successful and peaceful.</strong><u>Time teaches us discipline</u>, helps us reach our goals, and gives structure to our daily life. <mark>Wasting time can lead to stress and <sup>missed</sup><sub>opportunities.</sub></mark> So, we should respect time and make the most of every second.</p>
