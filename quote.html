	<blockquote>The sky at dusk tells a quiet story. <address>As the sun sets, golden light fades into soft pinks and deep purples,</address> painting the horizon with peace.<q> Birds return to their nests, and the world slows down for a moment.</q> It’s a time when silence feels comforting, like a warm blanket after a long day. In that <cite>stillness</cite> our thoughts often become clearer, reminding us to pause, breathe, and be present. Dusk is not just the end of a day—it’s a gentle reminder that endings can be beautiful too.</blockquote>
